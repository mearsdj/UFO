# UFO

## Challenge Overview
The goal of this project was to create an interactive table using `java script` and `html`. The table allows a user to filter the results shown in the table based on multiple criteria simultaneously. 

## Results
The table is searchable!
To zero in on UFO sighting specifics, you can search the table by:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- UFO Shape

Simply select the box(es) below the features you'd like to search on, and type your desired search parameters. The table will reflect the resuls as soon as you hit enter/tab or switch to different box.

See below for a video demonstarting the search capabilities.

## Summary

### Challenges
The searchable table works nicely, but one potential drawback is the need to clear old search criteria.

### Recommendations for further development
To improve the usability and utiliy of the UFO website, the following improvements can be made:
- Add a button to allow all search criteria to be filtered
- Allow the user to initiate the filter process. Though this table is small and filters very quickly, if the dataset was massive, it could be time wasting to filter as each criterion is entered.
- Update the data in the table so that it has more up-to-date results, in addition to historical sightings.
